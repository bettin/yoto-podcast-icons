## What is this?

If you've ever loaded a podcast onto Make Your Own cards, you know the Yoto player's screen shows a small icon for each track. Without a custom icon, tracks can be hard to tell apart — especially when kids are browsing on their own.

This tool generates **16x16 pixel PNG icons** that clearly display the **season and episode number** (e.g. S01 / E05) so every track is instantly identifiable on the player's screen.

## Why use it?

- **Kids can find episodes themselves** — no more "which card is episode 7?"
- **Color-coded seasons** — each season gets its own color, so Season 1, Season 2, etc. are visually distinct at a glance
- **Follows Yoto's guidelines** — icons are 16x16 PNG with transparent backgrounds, avoiding black (which doesn't show on the player's dark display)
- **Batch download** — generate up to 20 seasons x 99 episodes in one ZIP file, organized into folders
- **Free and open source** — runs entirely in your browser, nothing to install

## How to use it

1. **Go to [bettin.github.io/yoto-podcast-icons](https://bettin.github.io/yoto-podcast-icons/)**
2. **Pick a color palette** — choose from 8 options (Original, CMYK, Warm, Cool, Pastel, Neon, Rainbow, and more)
3. **Set your counts** — how many seasons and episodes per season you need
4. **Download** — hit the big green button to get a ZIP with all your icons, or click any individual icon to save it on its own

Then upload the icons to your tracks in the Yoto app when setting up your Make Your Own cards.

## Example

Each icon shows the season number in color and the episode number in white on a tiny 16x16 grid:

```
 ┌────────────────┐
 │  S 0 1         │  ← season number in color
 │  E 0 5         │  ← episode number in white
 └────────────────┘
      16x16 px
```

The preview shows them zoomed to 3x so you can see the detail, but the actual exported files are 16x16 pixels — exactly what the Yoto player expects.

## Background options

- **Transparent (default, recommended)** — follows Yoto's guidance for best results on the player display
- **Dark** — adds a dark background if you prefer a filled icon

## Tips for Yoto Make Your Own cards

- You can assign one icon per track when setting up a playlist in the Yoto app
- Icons display on the Yoto player's screen when browsing tracks
- The player's display background is dark/black, so avoid pure black in your icons
- For podcasts with lots of episodes, the color-coded seasons make it much easier for kids to navigate
